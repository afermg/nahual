# Nahual: Deploy and access image and data processing models via HTTPS.

Note that this is early work in progress.

This tool aims to provide a one-stop-shop source for multiple models to process imaging data or their derivatives. You can think of it as a much simpler [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) but for biological analyses, deep learning-based or otherwise.

In Mesoamerican folklore, a Nahual is a sorcerer able to transform into different animals.

## Implemented tools 
- [[https://github.com/afermg/baby][Baby]]: Segmentation, tracking and lineage assignment for budding yeast.

## To implement
- [[https://github.com/weigertlab/trackastra][trackastra]]: Transformer-based models trained on a multitude of datasets.
